# Hill-and-Valley-Prediction
Hill and Valley prediction is a binary classification problem where the goal is to determine whether a given set of data points represents a "hill" (a peak) or a "valley" (a trough). Logistic regression is well-suited for this type of problem, as it is designed to predict binary outcomes.
